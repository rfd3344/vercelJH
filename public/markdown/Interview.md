> _SRP - Single Responsibility Principle_

> _OCP - Opened Closed Principle_Â·

- add new function for new requirement, not change existing function
- open for extension, close for modification

> _LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle_

- subclass can replace superclass without error
- override method from superclass should keep same input and output parameters

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56860/what-is-an-example-of-the-liskov-substitution-principle

> _ISP Interface Segregation Principle_

- break interface to small, not fat interface

> _DIP Dependency Inversion Principle_

- high-level class depends on abstract/interface, not low-level classes

## System Design

- Design Patterns: Event-driven architecture, pub/sub, database replication

## Design Pattern

#### Creation Patterns

- Creation
-
- Singleton (GlobalInstance)
- Factory (MostCommon, ReactComponent)
- Builder (ComplexObject, Flexible, Multi-Step)
- Prototype (ReuseObject, ExpensiveToCreate)

#### Structural Patterns

- Assemble to large Object
-
- Adapter (IncompatibleInterface)
- Bridge (DecoupleAbstraction)
- Composite (ReactChildComponent)
- Decorator (HighOrderComponent)
- Facade (CombineMultiStep)
- Flyweight (ReduceMemoryByShareProperty)
- Proxy (ControlAccess)

#### Behavioral Patterns

- deal with Object Communication

- Observer (ReactHooks)
- Strategy: Allows a family of algorithms to be defined and swapped interchangeably at runtime.
- Command (Undo/Redo )
- Chain of Responsibility (ReduxMiddleware)
- Mediator (Redux)
- State (SwitchMode)
- Visitor: Separates an algorithm from the objects it operates on.
- Template Method Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm.
